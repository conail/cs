<p><strong><font color="#003300" size="4">The 1805 Will of James C. DeNeale</font></strong></p>
<p>This will was one of several written By James C. DeNeale of Fairfax County 
  Virginia (great Grandfather x5) through<br>
  Grandma Obermeyer's dad's line.<br>
  <br>
  It was written a year before his death in 1806. There are some discrepencies 
  with the names of his daughters<br>
  here in the will and from other documents I have come across. One strange thing 
  is that one of the slaves mentioned<br>
  is named Lina (and mom always told me Grandma foundy my name in a newspaper 
  clipping!). It is revealing<br>
  in this document how, there is not only a discrepency in the treatment of blacks 
  and whites, but also of women and men. <br>
