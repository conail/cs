<font color="#003300" size="5">William Jenners on his quest to &quot;Fight&quot; 
with the<br>
Blackfoot Indians near Lafayette in the 1830s </font> 
<p>This is an interesting and funny story I found about our great, great, great 
  uncle, <br>
  Colonel William Jenners, the uncle of Grandma Obermeyer's father. The first 
  part <br>
  is about early Lafayette, while the part in green is the story about William.</p>
