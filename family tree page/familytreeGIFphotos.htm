<p align="center">Hello family members,</p>
<p align="center">As some of you know, I began researching family roots in late 
  October. While googling around, I stumbled into the well-documented research 
  of Sue Beach, from Muncie, Indiana. She told me that I was her husband's fourth 
  cousin once removed (a decendent of Saurin Jenner's sister) and promptly emailed 
  the compilation of fifteen years of research (the Jenner's line) to me and only 
  asked that I pass it around to the Jenners side of the family. First she emailed 
  a 72 page document (the last 54 being bibliography) beginning with our own Grandma 
  Obermeyer and going all the way back to 1470 in Horsemondon (County Kent), England. 
  The document goes back 17 generations from my daughters, encompassing ancestors 
  who came to the new world as Puritans to begin new settlements and trade (or 
  fight) with the Indians, or to be an advocate for the &quot;witches&quot; of 
  Salem. Others fought in the very first attack against the British in the Revolutionary 
  War, and another sold land to George Washington to help create the District 
  of Columbia. Still others died horrific deaths in a natural gas explosion. A 
  lot of information to process! Since then she's sent detailed research on eight 
  individuals of this line. These documents can be emailed to you, so just ask 
  and I can send them. I've posted a summary of everything below, sumarizing some 
  things, adding additional info to others. Mary Anthrop (the living one, of course) 
  sent me a document of our Anthrop genealogy which was originally compiled for 
  the 1929 (second annual) Anthrop reunion, along with updates. The reunion is 
  still held every summer in Lafayette, Indiana.</p>
<p align="center">For the Obermeyer, Hulka and Chesak lines, I'm making headway 
  with help from relatives such as Rose Marie Pagel (Great Aunt Blanch Hulka's 
  daughter) and Susie Obermeyer, plus a bit of my own research and help from our 
  friend Gio pulling up ship manifests, census papers and other documents. Dad 
  had taken pictures of a large cache of photos and papers from the Hulka side, 
  so with that, I ran across more interesting images and facts. He put them all 
  on a disk which is available to family members. I hope you enjoy finding out 
  about your ancestry as much as I have.</p>

  Photo of &quot;Innisfail,&quot; a stone house in Fairfax County built by James 
  C. DeNeale (great grandfather x5) in 1771.<br>
  It is only a ten minute drive from us and is still standing. The upper floor 
  is said to be inhabited by a &quot;friendly ghost&quot; which watches over the 
  property.<br>
  The second image is the survey James made of the property in 1770 by which he 
  realized they owned 552 acres,<br>
  rather than the 300 that his wife Theodosia has been willed. Rob and I came 
  close to purchasing two acres of this land in 2001, not realizing it had once 
  been owned by ancestors. On January 15, 2008 the girls and I went to knock on 
  the door but nobody was home. I don't know if it was the thought that one of 
  my grandparents was most likely born there, or whether the &quot;friendly ghost&quot; 
  was trying to tell me something but as I opened the outer door to drop a note 
  behind it, all the hair on my head stood on end!</font></p>

  after being discharged from the Mexicn-American War (mid 1800s). Apparently

      <td width="715"><p align="left">A summary I put together on his life (pretty 
          amazing stuff):</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(Major) Simon Willard (4633)</font><br>
          baptized 7 April 1605 at Saint Margaret's Church, Horsmondon, Kent England, 
          married Mary Sharpe circa 1631 at Kent, England,<br>
          died 24 April 1676 in Suffolk County, MA. of an &quot;epidemic cold&quot; 
          which killed 600 others in New England<br>
          <br>
          A Puritan, trained as an engineer and soldier, Simon immigrated in 1634 
          with his wife, sister, and brother to escape religious persecution. 
          He first had a government land grant of 100 acres in &quot;New Towne&quot; 
          Cambridge, Massachusetts on the west side of the river. While trading 
          with the Indians (selling furs to England), he learned their language. 
          Some said they had some land which he could purchase. By 1635 he sold 
          his 100 acres to go to a far &quot;western frontier&quot; and established 
          &quot;the plantation of Musketaquid&quot; (which they named Concord) 
          Mass. together with Reverend Peter Bulkely (New settlements required 
          both a military leader and a religious leader). They brought along 12 
          other families (one of them being William Butterick and family (another 
          grandfather (x8) whose great grandsons fought in the first charge of 
          the Revolutionary War). A sign is posted in the center of Concord which 
          marks the spot where Willard traded for land with Squaw Sachem (or woman 
          chief ) under a great oak tree. He traded hatchets, hoes, knives, cotton 
          cloth and a little wampumpeage (money). In addition, Webbacowet, Squaw 
          Sachem's husband wanted to look like Simon Willard, so they gave him 
          a &quot;a suit of cotton cloth, an hat, a white linen band, shoes, stockings, 
          and a great coat, upon said bargain&quot;. In return, the Indians gave 
          them the &quot;six myles of land square&quot; which was to become Concord. 
          The land had earlier been inhabited by Indians, but most died from diseases 
          such as Smallpox, that earlier Europeans had brought with them.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;From &quot;A History of Concord&quot; by Lemuel Shattuck, 1835, 
          referring to King Philip's War (the earliest war between the Colonists 
          and the Indians &#8211; &quot;King Philip&quot; was an Indian chief): 
          &quot;In 1654, an expedition had been undertaken by the United Colonies 
          against Ninigret, principal Sachem (chief of the Niantics, which were 
          a branch of the Naraganset Indians), when &#8220;250 foot and 40 horsemen 
          were raised and sent fourth under the Christian and courageous Major 
          Willard of Concord as commander in chief&#8221;. This was the first 
          time that the early colonists were engaged in war. His house was burned 
          to the ground in one of the Indian attacks. He commanded the Middlesex 
          County militia for nearly 40 years and was the assistant to the governor 
          for many years.<br>
          <br>
          Simon had 17 children from three wives. We are from the first wife, 
          Mary Sharpe, descending from their daughter Elizabeth (see pieces of 
          her wedding dress below). One of her (full) brothers was Reverend Samuel 
          Willard, one of the major advocates for the women accused in &nbsp;the 
          Salem Witch trials of 1692 (people accused him of being a witch as well, 
          but his high standing protected him from real scrutiny). He was one 
          of the leading intellectuals of American Puritanism, in favor of relaxing 
          the heavy restrictions imposed on church members. As pastor of Boston's 
          &quot;South Church&quot;, he baptized Benjamin Franklin. He became acting 
          president of Harvard University, and his son Joseph eventually became 
          president. The second two wives were sisters &#8211; daughters of the 
          president of Harvard.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          In a speech given at a recent &quot;Willard Family Association&quot; 
          reunion, it was said that Simon and two siblings he immigrated with 
          have over a million descendents. It was also mentioned in the same speech 
          that Simon Willard is thought to have named Walden Pond in Concord, 
          later made famous by Henry David Thoreau. </p></td>

  <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><font color="#000000">From 
  the Willard Memoir; Life and Times of Major Simon Willard, 1858, by Joseph Willard.<br>

  of Simon's) at the time he wrote Simon's memoir in 1858, since it references 
  things that happened after Simon's death.</font></em></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  <br>
  Simon Willard, born 1606, died 1676.<br>
  To my children, - for so I call you, though belonging to different generations, 
  - listen to my words of instruction, warning, and advice. <br>
  It is my privilege and my duty to hold converse with you, as I have been constituted 
  by our heavenly Father, the founder of a numerous race on these Western shores. 
  Born before the settlement of Jamestown and Plymouth, and of an age to remember 
  the voyage of the 'Mayflower,' - the news whereof was brought even to my retired 
  village of Horsmonden, - I was permitted to live through an important epoch, 
  when great principles were in discussion, the settlement of which would affect 
  future generations in the establishment of justice and right, or the perpetuation 
  of wrong under the forms of law.<br>
  The death of my mother, of blessed memory, when I was too young to know the 
  extent of my loss, and that of a father in my early youth, not, indeed, before 
  remembered words of counsel and affection, but when I needed his protection 
  and guidance, left me exposed to the temptations which invade the humble village 
  as well as the larger resorts of men. But, though assailed, through God's mercy 
  I was saved from falling; and trusting in Him whom I had been in youth taught 
  reverence, I was brought safely through.<br>
  My early training was in the church of England; and in the ancient parish church 
  I received in my infancy, the waters of baptism by the hands of the rector, 
  Rev. Edward Alchine, from whose instructions and catechetical teachings, when 
  I came of age to understand them, I trust that I received spiritual benefit. 
  But my religious preferences were in another direction, and I yielded to their 
  persuasions. I well remember, even with the dawn of reason and reflection, the 
  great controversy, which was then beginning to range with unwonted heat, even 
  to the dividing of families.<br>
  I had none to aid me in shaping my future course; and though I was prospered 
  in business and very happy with the wife of my choice, and might have borne 
  my part in my native village, the feeling increased, that this was not my proper 
  sphere. Neighbors and friends, the men of Kent, in various quarters, were preparing 
  to remove to the New World, where success had attended the Plymouth settlers, 
  and the larger and more imposing colony composed of those who lined the shores 
  of this beautiful bay. I was in sympathy with these Christians, while still 
  loving the church from which I had separated, and the 'tender milk' drawn from 
  her breasts.<br>
  I saw the day approaching when sharp trials would begin, and I should be excluded 
  from the few religious privileges which remained for those who already were 
  stigmatized as schismatic. I determined to join those who were seeking a home 
  in the wilderness, where we might worship God in a way which we thought was 
  of his appointment. But how was this to be accomplished with a young family? 
  Measures of detention, which had now well-nigh reached their culminating point, 
  were daily becoming more stringent, requiring certificates of uniformity, and 
  oaths of allegiance and supremacy, of all who purposed embarking for the New 
  World. Vessels were carefully watched; and none could leave the realm, and take 
  passage for New England, without special permission, and having submitted to 
  various orders exacted by authority. I closed up my business in Horsmonden, 
  made my preparations diligently and silently in connection with a married sister 
  and her husband, and bidding an affectionate adieu to those of the family left 
  behind, reached the coast in safety, where we found a boat in readiness to take 
  us to the vessel which was to bear us to our coveted retreat.<br>
  I cannot describe to you my sensations on forsaking my native land. Scarce ever 
  beyond the bounds of my little village, I was leaving home, with all its fond 
  ancestral associations, never to return. My emotions, on taking the last view 
  of dear Old England, were such as almost to over power me. All of love, all 
  of memory, returned; and I felt for the moment a doubt, whether I was in the 
  way of duty in my removal. But it was only for a moment. When the last speck 
  of Kentish shore disappeared below the horizon, I girded myself to the undertaking; 
  cast no more lingering looks behind, but looked forward over the wide waste 
  of waters towards my detained abode; addressed myself to all that belonged to 
  its duties and obligations; and never at any one moment afterwards, until the 
  day that God called me hence from earthly scenes, did I regret the resolution 
  I had taken. We were favored in our passage, and our little fleet reached these 
  shores in the beautiful noontide of May, when all nature was bursting into life, 
  as if to give us a glad and smiling welcome to the new home of our pilgrimage.<br>
  I look around me; but all is changed that is under the power or control of man. 
  In the populous towns and cities which have sprung up, I cannot recognize the 
  little hamlets, once my familiar acquaintance. Even my ancient dwelling places 
  - peaceful and humble abodes in Cambridge, Concord, Lancaster, and Groton - 
  can no longer be traced or divined, except by those marks which God himself 
  has established in the flowing waters of the Charles, the Assabet, and the Nashaway. 
  Strange sights and sounds salute my senses; mysterious agencies of motion on 
  land and water are all around me; and I almost feel as if man was in communion 
  with forbidden spirits.<br>
  Descendants, - Here I planted my stakes; here I made my home, nor wished to 
  return to the scenes of my youth. My venture here in new and untried existence, 
  and I loved it. God favored me with health, friends, and beloved children; while, 
  by his will and the love of the brethren, I trust I was helpful to the Commonwealth, 
  at least in some humble measure, in military, legislative, and judicial service, 
  through a long period, until my death. For all that I was enabled to do I was 
  truly grateful, while conscious of my shortcomings, and lamenting that my success 
  did not equal my intentions.<br>
  It was my earnest wish to train up my children to walk in paths of virtue and 
  usefulness, and to educate them in human learning according to their capacities, 
  that they might serve their generation with fidelity. Herein I was aided and 
  blessed in the schools, open to all, which our honored magistrates and deputies 
  caused to be established, that 'learning might not be buried in the grave of 
  our fathers, in church and commonwealth; 'and by the teachings and instructions 
  of worthy Mr. Bulkeley and Mr. Rowlandson. By their regular attendance on public 
  worship, by observing the ordinances, by worship in the family, my sons and 
  daughters were in the sure way of preparation for good service in life and becoming 
  examples to their own children.<br>
  And now, if, in the day of small things, when we were few in number and weak 
  in power, surrounded by the savage, with none under God to help us save our 
  own right arm, I was of any service to church or commonwealth, I desire to first 
  of all thank God, and give him praise. I will not offer myself as an example 
  for imitation, or commend myself for having done aught, but only say that I 
  have endeavored.<br>
  Consider what God has done for you. The wilderness and the solitary place have 
  been made glad for you; and the desert rejoices, and blossoms as the rose, as 
  in the days of Isaiah for the chosen people. Indeed, the little one has become 
  a thousand; and the small beginnings, which I witnessed, have widened out to 
  a powerful commonwealth, filled with comforts, privileges, and blessings, countless 
  in number and leaving little to be imagined or desired. Think not that your 
  own right hand has wrought out this your happy condition; but give thanks to 
  Him to whom they belong, and believe that never was a people more highly favored.<br>
  You would honor my memory, and are very free in expressing veneration: but if 
  you would honor me aright, if you feel the veneration you express, show it by 
  your deeds; by reverence of that which is higher and holier; by doing all your 
  duty actively and earnestly in your generation; by adhering to the old paths 
  of justice, faithfulness, and holy trust; by sincerity in belief, abandoning 
  all Antinomian heresies as you would the other extreme of dead formalism; by 
  being bold for the right, modestly and firmly maintaining your opinions, whether 
  called to public station or in the more private walks; following no man and 
  no cause because of popularity, shunning no man and no cause you believe to 
  be right because of unpopularity or reproach; but avoiding the parasite and 
  self seeker, and standing bravely by your own convictions. Thus did my son, 
  even Samuel, in the time of his pilgrimage, when he set himself in opposition 
  to the greatest delusion that ever visited this land, subjecting himself to 
  great trial in the coldness of friends, and the harsh judgment of an entire 
  community; but, unmoved in his purpose, sustained by his conscientious view 
  of the right, calmly awaited that revolution in sentiment which at once was 
  the earnest and reward of his long and patient suffering.<br>
  &quot;Farewell !&quot; <br>
  Simon Willard</font><br>
  <br>
  * Simon is making reference to his son, Rev. Samuel Willard, who studied witchcraft 
  for twenty-years prior <br>
  to the Salem Witch trials and took a stance against the Rev. Cotton Mather, 
  an advocate in the matter of the trials.<br>
  Simon Willard, with Peter Bulkeley, bought Concord (Mass.) from the native Indians.<br>
  For twenty-two years Major Willard held the highest offices in the gift of the 
  people. He was one of the <br>
  Governor's council, a member of the Supreme Judicial Court, and deputy to the 
  General Court for fifteen years.<br>

  <br>
  Mural showing <strong>Reverend Samuel Willard (Simon's son and our great uncle 
  x10),</strong> &quot;one of the few voices of reason&quot; during the Salem 
  witch trials. He played an important role in halting the trials, as he urged 
  caution in the accusing and trying of witches. Willard also denounced spectral 
  evidence, claiming that the devil could impersonate even the innocent by appearing 
  in their shape. Samuel later became a vice president (and acting president) 
  of Harvard University and, as pastor of the &#8220;The Olde South Church&#8221; 
  in Boston, he happened to baptize Benjamin Franklin shortly before his own death.

  From &quot;The Story of the Bloods&quot; Elizabeth was described as &quot;A 
  young and beautiful maiden with a dowery consisting of 1000 acres of land, she 
  was the daughter of the most illustrious man in Concord, Major Simon Willard&quot;. 
  Her bridgroom Robert Blood, who also immigrated from England, was a big land 
  owner, He was described in the same document as &quot;a man untamed, independent, 
  perhaps even unruly, a man not of Concord.&quot; (It was rare for any &quot;civilized&quot; 
  people of the time to live outside the bounds of the tightly controlled Puritan 
  communities.) Photos courtesy Sue Beach.</p>

<p align="center">This is John Anthrop (father of Mary, above) from Amsterdam, 
  Holland. He is Grandma Obermeyer's mom's father. He came <br>
  with his wife, Cecilia Yakingnaw and several of their children in 1853. He was 
  originally a weaver but spent the rest of his life as a <br>
  woodcutter, then farmer. They came in through New York and went immediately 
  to Lafayette where they moved 10 times before finally <br>
  buying a farm of their own, but not before his wife died. It is said that he 
  bereaved her the rest of his life. They had a total of five <br>
  boys (one dying as an infant) and one daughter, Mary, who was about 9 when her 
  mother died. She assumed the household duties for her dad and brothers, who 
  worked on the farm.</p>
